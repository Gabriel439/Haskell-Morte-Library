{-| Morte lets you import external expressions located either in local files or
    hosted on network endpoints.

    To import a local file as an expression, just prepend the file path with a
    hash tag.  For example, suppose we had the following three local files:

    > -- id
    > \(a : *) -> \(x : a) -> x

    > -- Bool
    > forall (Bool : *) -> forall (True : Bool) -> forall (False : Bool) -> True

    > -- True
    > \(Bool : *) -> \(True : Bool) -> \(False : Bool) -> True

    You could then reference them within a Morte expression using this syntax:

    > #id #Bool #True

    ... which would embed their expressions directly within the syntax tree:

    > -- ... expands out to:
    > (\(a : *) -> \(x : a) -> x)
    >     (forall (Bool : *) -> forall (True : Bool) -> forall (False : Bool) -> True)
    >     (\(Bool : *) -> \(True : Bool) -> \(False : Bool) -> True)

    Imported expressions may contain imports of their own, too, which will
    continue to be resolved.  However, Morte will prevent cyclic imports.  For
    example, if you had these two files:

    > -- foo
    > #bar

    > -- bar
    > #foo

    ... Morte would throw the following exception if you tried to import @foo@:

    > morte: 
    > ⤷ #foo
    > ⤷ #bar
    > Cyclic import: #foo

    You can also import expressions hosted on network endpoints.  Just use a
    hashtag followed by a URL:

    > #http://host[:port]/path

    The compiler expects the downloaded expressions to be in the same format 
    as local files, specifically UTF8-encoded source code text.

    For example, if our @id@ expression were hosted at @http://example.com/id@,
    then we would embed the expression within our code using:

    > #http://example.com/id

    You can also reuse directory names as expressions.  If you provide a path
    to a local or remote directory then the compiler will look for a file named
    @\@@ within that directory and use that file to represent the directory.

{-| Morte tries to ensure that all expressions hosted on network endpoints are
    weakly referentially transparent, meaning roughly that any two clients will
    compile the exact same result given the same URL.

    To be precise, a strong interpretaton of referential transparency means that
    if you compiled a URL you could replace the expression hosted at that URL
    with the compiled result.  Let's term this \"static linking\".  Morte (very
    intentionally) does not satisfy this stronger interpretation of referential
    transparency since \"statically linking\" an expression (i.e. permanently
    resolving all imports) means that the expression will no longer update if
    its dependencies change.

    In general, either interpretation of referential transparency is not
    enforceable in a networked context since one can easily violate referential
    transparency with a custom DNS, but Morte can still try to guard against
    common unintentional violations.  To do this, Morte enforces that a
    non-local import may not reference a local import.

    Local imports are defined as:

    * A file

    * A URL with a host of @localhost@ or @127.0.0.1@

    All other imports are defined to be non-local
